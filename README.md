hello! This repo has the code and data files I am working with for MAT summer residency

sed.py is a commented python script that calculate CO & CO2 indices for brown dwarf 2MASS_J04151954-0935066

I use the same logic and code in carbon_index.py to loop over the 12 brown dwarfs in our sample.

carbon_index.py generates the png images in the base directory. Each png shows a zoom in of a MIRI spectrum of that object and the samples used for continuum and absorption.
